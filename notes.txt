Discuss different ways and time complexities of solving the following problem: 

Given an arrays and a number k, find the kth smallest element 

sort solution and solve: time nlogn 

using min heap and extract k times: time n + klogn 

using max heap: time n + (n-k)logn 

using modified quick sort: worst n squared, average n 

what does the async keyword do? 

Putting asyn before a function declarationmakes the function always return a promise (return value can be a promist or not) 

What doe sthe await keyword do? 

Makes javascript wait until that promise sttles and returns the result. calling await on/in a non asynchronous funciton will result in a syntax error.
