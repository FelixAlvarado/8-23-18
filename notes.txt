Discuss different ways and time complexities of solving the following problem: 

Given an arrays and a number k, find the kth smallest element 

sort solution and solve: time nlogn 

using min heap and extract k times: time n + klogn 

using max heap: time n + (n-k)logn 

using modified quick sort: worst n squared, average n
